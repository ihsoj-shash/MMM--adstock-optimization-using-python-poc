# adstock_rate_optimization_poc
The poc is a basic hands on implementation of adstock rate optimization.
The file used for analysis is openly available for download at "https://analyticsartist.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/adstock-rate-deriving-with-analytical-methods/"
The analyst has done same thing in excel but used GRG Non linear solver for Least squares. Here, my friend and I have tried to solve it by minimizing average of SSE.
